I have been thinking about starting a technical blog for a long time and never quite took the time to.
I just started a batch at the Recurse Center today and I decided that this would be my cue
to launch this blog. So here we go!

The [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) (nicknamed RC) is a place where
programmers come to become better at their craft.
It is a 6- or 12-week self-directed retreat, which means that everybody here works on whatever appeals the
most to them, or whatever they want to become better at.

In my case, I want to deepen my understanding of database management systems (DBMS) and how they work under the hood.
I think a good way to deeply understand how things work is to reimplement them from scratch.
So, my plan is to reimplement a few of those systems from the ground up: hopefully, one log-structured storage engine
and one page-oriented storage engine, but we'll see!

As for this series of posts on RC: I will report my progress on my projects and (try to) write one thing I learned (or
struggled with) every day.
I believe this will be useful mainly to my future self, but hopefully there might be one or two other souls out there
who could learn from this too!
