While I wanted to add tests on my locking mechanisms, I came upon an interesting bug.
Here is a simplification of it:

```python
lambda_functions = []
for i in range(5):
    lambda_functions.append(lambda: i)

# Executing the lambda functions
results = [func() for func in lambda_functions]
print(results)
```

I would have expected this to print `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`.
Instead, I got `[4, 4, 4, 4, 4]`!

What is happening here comes from the way that closures capture variables:

- Python uses lexical scoping: this means that they remember the name of the closed-over variable (`i` in our example)
  where it is created.
- But these variables are late-binding: this means that the value attached to the name is looked up when the closure is
  _executed_, not when it is _created_.

In this case, the lambda functions are executed outside the `for` loop, when the `i` variable is set to `4`. This is
why we get `[4, 4, 4, 4, 4]` instead of `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`.

If we set `i = 7` and then re-run `print([func() for func in lambda_functions])` then we would get: `[7, 7, 7, 7, 7]`.

In order to resolve the problem, we can create a new scope for each lambda by defining an additional
function (`create_lambda`) that captures the value of the loop variable (`i`) by passing it as an argument (therefore,
each lambda has its own `i` value):

```python
def create_lambda(x):
    return lambda: x


lambda_functions_corrected = []
for i in range(5):
    lambda_functions_corrected.append(create_lambda(i))

# Executing the corrected lambda functions
corrected_results = [func() for func in lambda_functions_corrected]
print(corrected_results)
```

Here, the `create_lambda` function is called at each iteration in the `for` loop.
Thus, each lambda function that is returned has its own scope with a copy of `i` at the time the lambda was created.
Therefore, the results printed are `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`. The issue is solved! Hurray! 🎉

For information, there is another way to handle this: we can capture the value of `i` at each iteration by using it as a
default parameter value for the lambda function.
Here is what it looks like:

```python
lambda_functions_corrected = []
for i in range(5):
    lambda_functions_corrected.append(lambda i=i: i)

# Executing the corrected lambda functions
corrected_results = [func() for func in lambda_functions_corrected]
print(corrected_results)
```

For reference, [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2295290/what-do-lambda-function-closures-capture) is where I
found the explanation for it!
