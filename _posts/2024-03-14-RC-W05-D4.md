After understanding that the `heapq` package relied on the way comparisons are implemented, I started
wondering about those. So today, I experimented a little bit with comparison dunder methods (`__lt__`, `__gt__`,
`__le__`, `__eq__`, ...).

To experiment, I created a simple `TestCompare` class that implements an `__eq__` and an `__lt__` dunder methods:

```python
class TestCompare:
    def __init__(self, key, id):
        self.key = key
        self.id = id

    def __eq__(self, other) -> bool:
        print(f"__eq__: self ({self.id}) VS other ({other.id})")
        return self.key == other.key

    def __lt__(self, other):
        print(f"__lt__: self ({self.id}) VS other ({other.id})")
        return self.key < other.key
```

If I test for equality between two instances of this class, we see that the `__eq__` method of the element on the left
is called:

```shell
>>> TestCompare(key="a", id=1) == TestCompare(key="a", id=2)
__eq__: self (1) VS other (2)
True
>>> TestCompare(key="a", id=2) == TestCompare(key="a", id=1)
__eq__: self (2) VS other (1)
True
```

Similarly, if I test for inferiority, we see that the `__lt__` method of the element on the left is called:

```shell
>>> TestCompare(key="a", id=1) < TestCompare(key="a", id=2)
__lt__: self (1) VS other (2)
False
```

So far so good: everything behaves as expected.

If I test for superiority though, I get an interesting result:

```shell
>>> TestCompare(key="a", id=1) > TestCompare(key="a", id=2)
__lt__: self (2) VS other (1)
False
```

The `__gt__` method ("greater than") is not implemented.
Thus, it seems that Python uses the `__lt__` method of the element on the right when the `__gt__` method of the element
on the left is not implemented. Interesting!

With this in mind, I thought that calling `<=` would probably check both inferiority (`<` with `__lt__`) and
equality (`=` with `__eq__`) when the "lower or equal" dunder method (`__le__`) was not implemented.
Let's check this:

```shell

>>> TestCompare(key="a", id=1) <= TestCompare(key="a", id=2)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: '<=' not supported between instances of 'TestCompare' and 'TestCompare'
```

Wrong! It throws an error saying that `<=` is not implemented.

All of this got me wondering as to why Python behaves this way, and I started reading
the [source code](https://github.com/python/cpython).

The code chunk that implements comparisons is in
the [`object.c` file](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/main/Objects/object.c) within the `do_richcompare`
function. The part that answers my question is the following:

```c
do_richcompare(PyThreadState *tstate, PyObject *v, PyObject *w, int op)
{
    richcmpfunc f;
    PyObject *res;
    int checked_reverse_op = 0;

    if (!Py_IS_TYPE(v, Py_TYPE(w)) &&
        PyType_IsSubtype(Py_TYPE(w), Py_TYPE(v)) &&
        (f = Py_TYPE(w)->tp_richcompare) != NULL) {
        checked_reverse_op = 1;
        res = (*f)(w, v, _Py_SwappedOp[op]);
        if (res != Py_NotImplemented)
            return res;
        Py_DECREF(res);
    }
    if ((f = Py_TYPE(v)->tp_richcompare) != NULL) {
        res = (*f)(v, w, op);
        if (res != Py_NotImplemented)
            return res;
        Py_DECREF(res);
    }
    if (!checked_reverse_op && (f = Py_TYPE(w)->tp_richcompare) != NULL) {
        res = (*f)(w, v, _Py_SwappedOp[op]);
        if (res != Py_NotImplemented)
            return res;
        Py_DECREF(res);
    }

    /* ... */
}
```

We have three `if` statements in there.
The last two seem to correspond to my observations:

- It tries the direct comparison operation from the first
  element `v` (`if ((f = Py_TYPE(v)->tp_richcompare) != NULL) { res = (*f)(v, w, op); /* ...*/ }`)
- Otherwise, it tries the reverse operation from the second
  element `w` (`if ((f = Py_TYPE(w)->tp_richcompare) != NULL) { res = (*f)(w, v, _Py_SwappedOp[op]); /* ...*/ }`).

Interestingly, there is another `if` statement that is tested before those two.
This checks if the second element `w` is a subtype of the first one `v`
(`if (!Py_IS_TYPE(v, Py_TYPE(w)) && PyType_IsSubtype(Py_TYPE(w), Py_TYPE(v)) && (f = Py_TYPE(w)->tp_richcompare) != NULL)`)
and performs the reverse operation on the second element if that is the case (`res = (*f)(w, v, _Py_SwappedOp[op]);`).

This implementation detail allows to handle polymorphism correctly.
Indeed, if a subclass has reimplemented a comparison method that was already implemented in the parent class, we want to
use the most specific method (that of the subclass).
So this extra check allows to handle subtype polymorphism as we expect it to behave!
